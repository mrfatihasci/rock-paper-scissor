#Title: The Odin Project- Rock Paper Scissors

##Description: 
This is an assignment given in The Odin Project (TOP>Foundations>Rock Paper Scissors), basically it prompts to player one of three, compares players selection to the computers random selection. Selection loop ends in the round 5. Result is displayed to player by Javascripts DOM manipulation.

##Note: 
The main reason is to start getting hands-on experience with Javascripts DOM Manipulation, functions and Events as well as to learn branching(create a develop branch, merge with the main, delete develop branch) in Git.

##Branching Note: 
git branch // see current branches. 
git branch <branch_name> //create a develop branch named branch_name. 
git checkout <branch_name> //change to <branch_name>. 
git merge <branch_name>  // take all commited changes in <branch_name> and add to branch you are currently on. 
git branch -d <branch_name>  //deletes <branch_name> if merged. 
git branch -D <branch_name> //delete branch if not merged.
git push origin <branch_name> // push branch
