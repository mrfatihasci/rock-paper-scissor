<li>git branch                      // see current branches. </li>
<li>git branch <branch_name>        // create a develop branch named branch_name. </li>
<li>git checkout <branch_name>      // change to <branch_name>. </li>
<li>git merge <branch_name>         // take all commited changes in <branch_name> and add to branch you are currently on. </li>
<li>git branch -d <branch_name>     // deletes <branch_name> if merged. </li>
<li>git branch -D <branch_name>     // delete branch if not merged.</li>
<li>git push origin <branch_name>   // push branch</li>
</ul>
